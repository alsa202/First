Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Complaint Prediction


Objective: The objective of this project is to build machine learning models to predict customer complaints and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using historical data. The project will focus on all steps of data science, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data processing, model building, evaluation, and visualization of results. Additionally, we aim to highlight trends in the data and provide actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction and targeting marketing campaigns more effectively.

2)Products: Purchase amounts spent on different product categories over the last two years.
3)Promotion: Information about customer responses to marketing campaigns.
4)Place: Purchase methods used by customers (web, catalog, store).

Based on the analysis, identify key trends such as:
Customers who tend to complain may have certain demographic characteristics or purchasing behaviors.
Segments identified through clustering can help tailor marketing strategies for different customer groups.
